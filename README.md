# Project title: Majanotes
# Project description:

I initially built this is as a group project 
it was originallly just a HTML/CSS/EJS template with Node
however I expanded it by adding a docker compose running mongodb

Anonymous journalling application built by 
* Jesse Dodoo (jessedodoo)
* Alina Laura Vizitiu (AlinaLauraV)
* Michael Nelson (mwezn)
* Andrew Upton (nottnottloop)

Made as a group project for futureproof

# Installation & usage

Then run `npm run dev` to start a server on http://localhost:3000

# Technologies
* [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
* [EJS](https://ejs.co/)
* [Giphy API](https://developers.giphy.com/)
* [Docker ]

# Process
Started by planning the features and work to be done
Initially we focused on prototyping and getting the backend working first:

Added some CSS files to style the website
Tested the features and the code

Then we fixed up the frontend and got it looking nicer:

We added a login system after we had finished the requirements for the project:

# Wins & Challenges
## Wins
Additional features include:
* Scoring system based on the popularity of a post, determined by its emoji count
	* More popular posts are placed higher in the feed
* Good server-side data verfication. Posts are not allowed if they don't have a title or body, or if the title and body are too long
	* Errors are displayed individually if there are multiple errors
	* All HTML tags are converted to ampersand character codes before being saved so HTML injection cannot occur

## Challenges
Using git for the team work
Dynamic card generation system posed a challenge to modifying the cards. Difference between static HTML and dynamic JS manipulation of elements
Testing
Strict equality of types vs coerced equality
DRY and WET code

# Future features:
Password hashing, 
Push notifications
More emojis
Security questions
Search option
